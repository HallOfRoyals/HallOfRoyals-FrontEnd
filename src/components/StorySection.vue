      <p>
        In February 1897, Benin City was captured by British forces in what was
        a bloody and devastating occupation. Following this occupation of Benin
        City by the British Empire was a massive looting of the Royal palace,
        shrines and several other parts of the Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thousands of objects of ceremonial and ritual value were taken to the UK
        as official 'spoils of war' or distributed among members of the
        expedition according to their rank. This included objects removed from
        royal ancestral shrines, among which were ceremonial brass heads of
        former Obas and their associated ivory tusks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The looted objects also included more than 900 brass plaques, dating
        largely to the 16–17th century, found in a storage room within the
        palace. Having previously decorated the palace walls, these plaques were
        key historic records for the Benin Court and kingdom, enabling
        illustration of historic practices and traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        These ancient Benin Bronze Heads were cast by specialist guilds working
        for the royal court. They were cast in honor of Kings and Queen mothers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, the Benin Bronze Heads are worth millions of Dollars with most of
        them on display in Museums across the UK.
